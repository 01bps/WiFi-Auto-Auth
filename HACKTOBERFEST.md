## Implement Password Encryption 
**Contributor ID:** AnikethBhosale
**Issue reference No.:** #4

### What I Changed:
- Integrated Fernet symmetric encryption for WiFi and dashboard passwords in `config.json` for enhanced security
- Passwords are now automatically encrypted on first run and stored securely in both config and database
- Added logic to prevent multiple encryption of already encrypted passwords
- Passwords are only decrypted in memory for login/authentication, never stored or logged in plaintext
- Updated README with an 'Updated Security Notes' section describing the new encryption workflow
- Added `cryptography` to `requirements.txt` to document the new dependency

**Files Changed:** `wifi_auto_login.py`, `dashboard.py`, `config.example.json`, `requirements.txt`, `readme.md`
